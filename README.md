# Surf's Up!
## Overview
In the Climate Analysis completed previously, we determined that Ohau would be a good location for W. Avy to open up a surf and ice scream shop.  Tto determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round he would like to see temperature data specifically for the months of June and December over the entire dataset.

The results of this project will provide W. Avy with a statistical summary for both the month of June and Dec. This will be followed by an summary of the statistics and additional queries that we can use to give additional weather data for these months if W. Avy would like more information before proceeding with the surf shop.

## Results:
TODO: add png files and description of results.

## Summary:
TODO: conclusion based on results plus 2 additional queries.
